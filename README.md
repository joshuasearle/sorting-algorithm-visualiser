# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser

This app allows you to choose one of many sorting algorithms, as well as the number of elements you'd like to sort. When you hit **RUN**, the sort will begin, animating all of the comparisons and swaps. While sorting, you can change the speed of the sort, and if you change the algorithm or the element count, the sort will stop.

### Currently Available Algorithms

- selection sort
- insertion sort

### TODO

- add bubble sort
- add shaker sort

- add **Randomise List** button
- find a way to speed up the animations
