# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser

<a href="https://joshuasearle.github.io/sorting-algorithm-visualiser/" target="_blank">click here to use it</a>

This app lets you visualise your favourite sorting algorithms.
You can pick the speed you'd like the animations to be, as well as change the speed mid visualisation.
You can pick the number of elements you'd like to animate, and the visualisation automatically stops if you change it mid sort.
You can pick one of many sorting algorithms listed below, and changing mid sort also automatically stops the visualisation.
You can instantly sort the elements to see how different algorithms react to already sorted lists.
You can instantly sort the elements in reverse order to see how different algorithms react to reverse sorted lists.
Instantly sorting the list, reverse or not, will also automatically stop the visualisation.
You can also manually stop the visualisation, so you can mix and match algorithms.

### Cool Sorting Algorithm Combos

- heap sort on a sorted list
- heap sort on a reverse sorted list
- merge sort on a reverse sorted list
- shaker sort on a reverse sorted list
- shaker sort on a sorted list
- quick sort for a few partitions, then stop the sort and switch to insertion sort for an efficient mix of algorithms

### Currently Available Algorithms

- selection sort
- insertion sort
- bubble sort
- shaker sort
- quick sort
- merge sort
- heap sort

### TODO

- ~add bubble sort~
- ~add shaker sort~
- ~add quick sort~
- ~add merge sort~
- ~add heap sort~
- ~change the run button so that is says **STOP** when sorting, and you can cancel it~
- fix the menu bar
- make the site more responsive
- ~add **Randomise List** button~
- ~refactor **visualise** action~
- ~refactor repeated animation code in sorting algs~
- ~condense animation actions~
- ~add reverse list button~
